# Buck-Boost Converter Efficiency Predictor with ML

## Objective
Predict **efficiency** of a bidirectional Buck-Boost converter using **Random Forest** based on input voltage, output current, and temperature.

## Data
- Simulated thermal and load behavior (aligned with my 2017 MSc thesis)
- Source: Mohan et al., *Power Electronics: Converters, Applications, and Design*, 2003

## Results
- **Prediction Accuracy: MAE = 2.34%**
- Application: **Design optimization, predictive maintenance**

## Run
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
jupyter notebook buckboost_ml_predictor.ipynb
